## Authentication

All requests to the MoviesDatabase API require an API key. You must include the following headers in each request:

- `X-RapidAPI-Key`: Your personal API key from RapidAPI
- `X-RapidAPI-Host`: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com

Keep your API key secret by storing it in an environment variable like `.env.local`.

## Error Handling

If something goes wrong, the API will return an error response. Common error codes:

- `401 Unauthorized`: API key is missing or invalid
- `403 Forbidden`: Access denied, usually due to rate limits
- `404 Not Found`: The movie or endpoint doesn't exist
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Something broke on the server

Use `try/catch` in your code and check the response status before using the data.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

- The API is rate-limited. Avoid making too many requests in a short time.
- Use pagination to load small chunks of data.
- Cache results locally when possible.
- Always handle loading and error states in your app.
- Keep your API key secret. Do not expose it to the frontend.
